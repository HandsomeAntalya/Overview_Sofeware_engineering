## Software development

Software development is the process of **designing**, **building**, **testing**, and **maintaining software** products or applications. It involves a systematic approach to developing software, which typically includes the following steps:

1. **Requirements gathering**: This involves understanding the needs and goals of the software product, and gathering requirements from stakeholders such as users, clients, and business analysts.
2. **Design**: This involves creating a detailed plan for the software product, including the architecture, user interface, data model, and other technical aspects.
3. **Implementation**: This involves writing the code for the software product, using programming languages and tools such as compilers, editors, and integrated development environments (IDEs).
4. **Testing**: This involves verifying that the software product meets the requirements and works as expected. Testing can include various techniques such as unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.
5. **Deployment(部署；调动)**: This involves releasing the software product to users, either on-premises or in the cloud.
6. **Maintenance**: This involves fixing bugs, making updates, and providing ongoing support for the software product to ensure it continues to meet the needs of users.

Software development can be done by individuals or teams, and can involve various methodologies such as Agile, Waterfall, and DevOps. It is a complex and dynamic field that requires a deep understanding of programming languages, software design patterns, and best practices.

## Software crisis

Background:

"software crisis" refers to a period in the **1960s and 1970s** when software development projects were struggling to deliver software that met the requirements of users, was delivered on time, and within **budget**. The term was coined by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1970, who argued that the problem was caused by the increasing complexity of software systems, and the lack of suitable programming tools and methodologies to manage that complexity.

The software crisis led to the development of new software engineering practices and techniques, including structured programming, modular design, and software testing. These practices helped to improve the quality and reliability of software, and led to the development of new programming languages, such as Pascal, Ada, and C.

**Software crisis today:**

Today, while the software crisis of the past has largely been addressed through advancements in software engineering practices, new challenges continue to arise as software systems become more complex and interconnected. These challenges include issues related to **security**, **scalability**, and the **management** of large and distributed software systems.

**Challenges we face today**: 

1. Security: With the rise of **cyber threats** and the increasing use of software in critical systems such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, security has become a major concern. Software developers must design and implement security measures to protect against threats such as hacking, data breaches, and malware. 安全性受到威胁
2. Complexity: Modern software systems can be **extremely complex**, with multiple components and dependencies that are difficult to manage. As software systems become more complex, it becomes more challenging to maintain and update them, leading to issues such as system downtime, performance problems, and bugs. 操作过于复杂
3. Interoperability(**互用性**): Software systems today often need to work with other systems, and ensuring that different systems can communicate and work together can be a challenge. This is especially true in industries such as healthcare and finance, where different systems must be able to exchange data and information securely and accurately. 和其他系统的兼容性
4. Scalability(**可扩展性**): Software systems must be able to handle increasing amounts of data and traffic as they grow, which can be a challenge for developers. Ensuring that software systems can scale up or down as needed without sacrificing performance or reliability is a key challenge.  处理日益增长的数据和流量
5. User experience: With the increasing focus on user-centric design, software developers must ensure that their products are easy to use, intuitive, and meet the needs of users. This can be a challenge when designing software for complex systems or specialized industries. 用户体验
6. Time to market is shorter than ever: the need to release products to market **quickly** in order to stay competitive. The increasing pace of innovation and the demand for new and better software products has led to shorter development cycles and tighter deadlines.

# Why do software project fail?

1. Poor Requirements Gathering: A software project may fail if the requirements for the software product are not clearly defined, or if they are poorly communicated to the development team. This can lead to misaligned expectations and poor design decisions that can affect the quality and functionality of the software. 需求收集不详尽/ over-ambitious requirements/ Unnecessary/ poor requirements. 
2. Lack of Project Management: Without a strong project management approach, software projects can easily fall behind schedule, go over budget, or fail to meet user needs. Effective project management includes setting clear goals and objectives, defining project scope, managing timelines, and ensuring that team members are working effectively and efficiently.（进程管理不到位）
3. Inadequate Testing: Testing is a critical component of software development, as it helps to identify and correct defects and ensure that the software meets the requirements of users. If testing is not performed adequately, defects may go unnoticed and software quality may suffer. （测试不够）
4. Technical Complexity: As software systems become more complex, it can be challenging for development teams to keep up with the latest technologies and techniques. This can lead to design flaws, security vulnerabilities, and other issues that can affect software quality and functionality.（软件系统过于复杂）
5. Communication Issues: Communication is critical to the success of software development projects. Without effective communication between team members, stakeholders, and users, misunderstandings and misaligned expectations can arise, leading to project delays, rework, or failure.（沟通不成功）
6. Lack of User Involvement: If users are not involved in the software development process, it can be challenging to ensure that the software meets their needs and expectations. This can lead to low user adoption rates and ultimately, project failure. （用户参与过少）
7. Poor Resource Management: Inadequate resources, including personnel, tools, and funding, can also contribute to software project failure. Without the necessary resources, development teams may struggle to meet project goals and objectives, leading to delays, quality issues, and other problems.（资源管理不到位）
8. Other factors like bad developers/ over budget/ contract management/ End-user training/ Operational management

1. Planning (Requirements Analysis): This involves understanding the needs and requirements of the software product, including its functionality, performance, and usability.
2. Analysis and design (high level and detailed): This involves analyzing the requirements and designing a software solution that meets those requirements. This may involve creating a high-level design that outlines the system architecture, or a detailed design that specifies the software components, interfaces, and data structures.
3.  Development / Coding and implementation: This involves writing the code that implements the software design, using programming languages and development tools.
4. Testing: This involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions as intended. This may involve manual testing, automated testing, or a combination of both.
5. Deployment: This involves deploying the software to the production environment, including installing the software, configuring it, and verifying that it is working as expected.
6. Maintenance: This involves maintaining the software over time, including fixing defects, updating functionality, and addressing security issues.
7. Documentation: This involves creating documentation that describes the software product, including its features, functionality, and usage instructions.

## Software development life cycle (SDLC)examples:

## Waterfall model:

In this model, the development process flows sequentially through stages such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each stage must be completed before moving to the next one.

关键词：依序进行;

开发过程是通过设计一系列阶段顺序展开的，从系统[需求分析](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/2012709?fromModule=lemma_inlink)
开始直到产品发布和维护，每个阶段都会产生循环反馈，因此，如果有信息未被覆盖或者发现了问题，那么最好 “返回”上一个阶段并进行适当的修改，项目开发进程从一个阶段“流动”到下一个阶段，这也是瀑布模型名称的由来。包括[软件工程](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B/25279?fromModule=lemma_inlink)开发、企业项目开发、产品生产以及市场销售等构造瀑布模型。

**课堂笔记：**

软件工程的基石；

按照顺序进行设计适合政府的一些项目；

但并不是所有的程序都适合这个模型；

The Waterfall model is a **linear** and **sequential** software development process that flows through a series of phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next one, with a focus on planning and documentation.

In the Waterfall model, the requirements gathering phase is typically the first phase of the development process. During this phase, the requirements for the software product are gathered and documented in detail. This includes identifying the functional and non-functional requirements of the software, as well as any constraints or limitations that may apply.

The Waterfall model is best suited for software development projects where the requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change significantly over time. It works well when the software product is relatively simple, with clear and unambiguous requirements. It is also well-suited for projects where a detailed project plan and schedule are important, as it emphasizes planning and documentation.  适合一开始需求就被详细告知的/简单的程序/清晰不模糊的需求

However, the Waterfall model can be less suitable for projects where the requirements are not well-defined or are likely to change over time. It can also be challenging for projects that require a high degree of collaboration or flexibility, as the linear and sequential nature of the model can limit the ability to make changes or adjustments as the project progresses.

不适合：一直改变的需求；需要高度协作或灵活性的项目；

### Advantages of Waterfall Development:

1. Predictability: Waterfall development is known for its predictability, as each stage of the development process is completed before moving onto the next. This makes it easier to plan and allocate resources. Easy to classify and prioritize tasks.
2. Clear milestones: Waterfall development has clear milestones, which makes it easier to track progress and manage the project.
3. Documentation: Waterfall development prioritizes documentation, which can be helpful for teams that need to maintain and update the software product over time.
4. Well-suited for well-defined projects: Waterfall development is well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements and a need for a predictable outcome.
5. Simple to use and understand 
6. Every phase has a defined result and process review;
7. Development stages go one by one;

### Drawbacks of Waterfall Development:

1. Limited flexibility: Waterfall development is less flexible than Agile development, which can make it difficult to adapt to changing requirements or circumstances.
2. Limited collaboration: Waterfall development is less collaborative than Agile development, which can lead to a lack of communication and collaboration between team members.
3. Risk of project failure: Waterfall development can be risky, as problems or issues may not be discovered until later stages of the development process.
4. Late feedback: Waterfall development may not provide feedback until the testing phase, which can be too late to make significant changes.
5. Miss complexity due to interdependence of decisions;
6. Not suited for long-tern project where requirements will change; 不适合较长期的项目

## Agile model:

In this model, development occurs in short iterations or sprints, with each iteration focusing on a specific set of requirements or features. Agile development emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and rapid feedback.

敏捷开发以用户的需求进化为核心，采用迭代、循序渐进的方法进行[软件开发](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91/3448966?fromModule=lemma_inlink)。在敏捷开发中，软件项目在构建初期被切分成多个子项目，各个子项目的成果都经过测试，具备可视、可集成和可运行使用的特征。换言之，就是把一个大项目分为多个相互联系，但也可独立运行的小项目，并分别完成，在此过程中软件一直处于[可使用状态](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8F%AF%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E7%8A%B6%E6%80%81/53651177?fromModule=lemma_inlink)。

CollabNet One 最近的一份报告显示，**97% 的组织现在都在实践敏捷开发方法**。敏捷受欢迎的秘诀在于能够更快地将软件开发解决方案推向市场。从提倡早期交付、持续开发、适应性规划以及灵活应对变化，敏捷软件开发使跨职能团队能够开发和迭代，从而更轻松地生产最小可行产品 (MVP)。不断收集和实施反馈。这一动态过程允许团队为实现一个目标而共同努力。

**敏捷与其说是一种方法论，不如说是一套价值观、理想和目标**

The Agile model is an **iterative** and **incremental software development** (迭代和增量的软件开发方法) approach that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and rapid feedback. The Agile model is based on the **[Agile Manifesto](https://www.notion.so/Agile-Manifesto-7a3c1afc778048db98092c6e5a7bd44b)**, a set of values and principles for software development that prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and response to change.

In the Agile model, development occurs in short iterations or sprints, with each iteration focusing on a specific set of requirements or features. The development team works closely with the customer or product owner to prioritize requirements and ensure that the software product meets their needs.

The Agile model emphasizes continuous **integration** and **delivery**, with a focus on delivering working software at the end of each iteration. The development team and customer or product owner collaborate closely throughout the development process, with a focus on rapid feedback and continuous improvement.

keywords of Agile:  flexibility, collaboration, and rapid feedback. 

一些特点 Here are some key features of Agile development:

1. Iterative and incremental: Agile development is based on short iterations or sprints, with each iteration focused on delivering a working software product. This iterative approach allows development teams to respond to feedback and changes quickly.
2. Collaboration: Agile development emphasizes collaboration between development teams, customers, and stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to ensure that the software product meets the needs of its users.
3. Flexibility: Agile development prioritizes flexibility and adaptability, allowing development teams to respond to changing requirements and circumstances quickly.
4. Continuous integration and delivery: Agile development emphasizes continuous integration and delivery, with a focus on delivering working software at the end of each iteration.
5. Customer-centric: Agile development is focused on delivering software products that meet the needs of customers and stakeholders. This customer-centric approach ensures that the software product is useful and valuable.
6. Rapid feedback: Agile development emphasizes rapid feedback, allowing development teams to respond to issues and changes quickly.
7. Self-organizing teams: Agile development encourages self-organizing teams, allowing team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions about how they work.

Drawbacks:

1. Lack of predictability: Agile development is focused on flexibility and adaptability, which can make it difficult to predict the final outcome of a project. This lack of predictability can be challenging for project managers and stakeholders who need to plan and allocate resources.(缺少可预测性）
2. Limited documentation: Agile development prioritizes working software over documentation, which can lead to a lack of comprehensive documentation. This can be challenging for teams that need to maintain and update the software product over time.（有限的文件记录）
3. Requires strong team collaboration: Agile development requires a high degree of collaboration and communication between team members. This can be challenging for teams that are not used to working together or have members who are geographically dispersed.（需要很强的小组合作）
4. Potential for scope creep: Agile development encourages flexibility and adaptability, which can lead to scope creep if requirements and priorities are not clearly defined and managed.（范围蠕变的可能性）
5. May not be suitable for all projects: Agile development is best suited for projects with changing or undefined requirements, where a high degree of flexibility and rapid feedback is required. It may not be the best approach for projects with well-defined requirements and a need for a predictable outcome. （可能不适合所有项目）

Agile is well-suited for projects where **customer feedback and collaboration** are key priorities. It emphasizes delivering working software in smaller iterations or sprints, allowing for frequent customer feedback and adjustments to the project based on that feedback. However, Agile may not be as effective for projects with a high degree of uncertainty or where risk management is a key priority (so we can consider spiral model).

## Spiral model:

In this model, the development process is iterative and includes phases such as planning, risk analysis, development, and evaluation. Each iteration builds on the previous one, with the goal of improving the software product over time.

![https://www.sovereignconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spiral-Model-Methodology.png](https://www.sovereignconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spiral-Model-Methodology.png)

The Spiral model is a software development process model that combines elements of both Waterfall and Agile development. It is an iterative model that emphasizes risk management and focuses on delivering a high-quality software product

螺旋模型是一种演化[软件开发过程](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E8%BF%87%E7%A8%8B/3758917?fromModule=lemma_inlink)模型，它兼顾了[快速原型](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%8E%9F%E5%9E%8B/7432267?fromModule=lemma_inlink)的[迭代](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BF%AD%E4%BB%A3/8415523?fromModule=lemma_inlink)的特征以及[瀑布模型](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%80%91%E5%B8%83%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B/9817778?fromModule=lemma_inlink)的系统化与严格监控。螺旋模型最大的特点在于引入了其他模型不具备的风险分析，使软件在无法排除重大风险时有机会停止，以减小损失。同时，在每个迭代阶段构建原型是螺旋模型用以减小风险的途径。螺旋模型更适合大型的昂贵的系统级的软件应用。 [1]

1988年，巴利·玻姆(Barry Boehm)正式发表了[软件](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6?fromModule=lemma_inlink)系统开发的“螺旋模型”，它将[瀑布模型](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%80%91%E5%B8%83%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B/9817778?fromModule=lemma_inlink)和prototying结合起来，强调了其他模型所忽视的风险分析，特别适合于大型复杂的系统。

The Spiral model is characterized by the following phases:

1. Planning: The first phase involves gathering requirements, defining project objectives, and identifying potential risks. The project is also planned out in terms of resources, timelines, and budget.
2. Risk analysis: In this phase, potential risks are identified and analyzed, and strategies are developed to mitigate them. The project is also evaluated in terms of its feasibility, and adjustments are made as necessary.
3. Engineering: The third phase involves developing the software product based on the requirements and objectives identified in the planning phase. The software is developed in smaller iterations or sprints, with each iteration building on the previous one.
4. Evaluation: In this phase, the software product is tested and evaluated to ensure that it meets the project objectives and requirements. Any issues or problems are identified and addressed in the subsequent iteration.

The Spiral model is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing development teams to adjust the project based on feedback and changing requirements. It emphasizes risk management, ensuring that potential issues are identified and addressed early in the development process.

Advantages:

1. Risk management: The Spiral model places a strong emphasis on risk management, allowing development teams to identify and mitigate potential issues early in the development process. 风险管理
2. Flexibility: The Spiral model is more flexible than the Waterfall model, allowing development teams to adjust the project based on feedback and changing requirements. 
3. Incremental delivery: The Spiral model uses incremental delivery, allowing development teams to deliver a working software product in smaller iterations or sprints. 增量交付
4. Customer feedback: The Spiral model allows for customer feedback throughout the development process, ensuring that the software product meets the customer's requirements.

Disadvantages:

1. Complexity: The Spiral model is more complex than other development models, requiring a high level of expertise and experience to implement effectively.
2. Cost and time: The Spiral model can be more expensive and time-consuming than other development models due to its iterative nature and risk management focus.
3. Documentation: The Spiral model requires extensive documentation, which can be time-consuming and may detract from development time.
4. Team coordination: The Spiral model requires strong team coordination and communication, which can be challenging for larger development teams or teams that are geographically dispersed.

Overall, the Spiral model is a **flexible** and **adaptable** development model that prioritizes risk management and customer feedback. While it may be more complex and time-consuming than other development models, it is well-suited for projects with a high degree of uncertainty or for teams that value risk management and customer feedback.

Spiral model is well-suited for projects with **a high degree of uncertainty** or where **risk management is a key priority**. It allows development teams to identify and mitigate potential risks early in the development process, and it is more flexible than the Waterfall model. However, it can be more complex and time-consuming than other models, and it requires a high level of expertise and experience to implement effectively.

## DevOps model (extra information):

In this model, development and operations teams work closely together throughout the software development life cycle, with a focus on continuous integration, delivery, and deployment. DevOps emphasizes **collaboration**, automation, and rapid feedback.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*n57zykBMdOdmUg7C.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*n57zykBMdOdmUg7C.png)

DevOps is a software development approach that combines the development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to work together throughout the entire software development lifecycle. The goal of DevOps is to increase collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to enable faster, more reliable software releases.

The DevOps model includes the following key practices:

1. Continuous Integration 持续集成 (CI): The practice of continuously merging code changes into a shared repository and verifying that the new code does not break the existing codebase.
2. Continuous Delivery 持续交付 (CD): The practice of automating the software deployment process to ensure that software releases can be quickly and reliably deployed to production.
3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 基础设施即代码: The practice of managing infrastructure through code, enabling faster and more reliable provisioning and configuration of infrastructure resources.
4. Continuous Monitoring (CM) 持续监控: The practice of continuously monitoring the software system in production to identify issues and make improvements.

One of the key advantages of the DevOps model is that it enables organizations to deliver software faster and with higher quality. By combining development and operations teams, the DevOps model can reduce the time and effort required to manage and deploy software, and improve the overall quality of the software by ensuring that it is continuously tested and monitored.

Advantages of DevOps:

1. Faster time to market: DevOps helps organizations to deliver software faster and more frequently, which can give them a competitive advantage in the market.
2. Improved collaboration: By combining development and operations teams, DevOps can improve communication and collaboration between teams, resulting in better software quality and reliability.
3. Increased efficiency: Automation and tooling in DevOps can help to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency in software development and deployment.
4. Better quality: DevOps promotes continuous testing and monitoring, which can improve software quality and reliability.
5. Improved customer satisfaction: With faster and more frequent releases, DevOps can help organizations to better meet customer needs and expectations.

Drawbacks of DevOps:

1. Cultural changes: Adopting DevOps often requires significant cultural changes within an organization, which can be challenging and time-consuming.
2. Investment in automation and tooling: DevOps requires investment in automation and tooling, which can be expensive and require significant resources.
3. Security risks: DevOps can increase security risks if proper security measures are not implemented throughout the software development lifecycle.
4. Complexity: DevOps can be complex, especially for larger organizations, and may require significant planning and coordination to implement effectively.
5. Learning curve: Adopting DevOps may require new skills and training for development and operations teams, which can be a challenge for some organizations.

## V-model:

In this model, the development process flows through phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and acceptance. Each phase has a corresponding testing phase, with testing occurring in parallel to development.

![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/V-Model.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/V-Model.png)

强调测试的一个模型；类似waterfall, 但是更多的测试

The V-model is a software development model that is similar to the Waterfall model but places a greater emphasis on **testing** throughout the development process. The name "V-model" comes from the shape of the model, which looks like a "V" when graphically represented.

The V-model includes the following stages, each of which has a corresponding testing stage:

1. Requirements gathering: In this stage, the project requirements are gathered and documented.
2. System design: In this stage, the high-level design of the software system is developed, including system architecture and interfaces.
3. Unit design: In this stage, the detailed design of each software component or module is developed.
4. Implementation: In this stage, the software code is written and tested at the unit level.
5. Integration: In this stage, the software components are integrated and tested as a complete system.
6. System testing: In this stage, the complete software system is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and performs as expected.
7. Acceptance testing: In this stage, the software system is tested by the customer or end-user to ensure that it meets their needs.

One of the key advantages of the V-model is that it places a strong emphasis on testing throughout the development process, which can help to identify and correct defects early in the development process. This can help to reduce the overall cost and time required for testing and debugging.

However, one potential disadvantage of the V-model is that it can be less flexible than other development models, such as Agile. The V-model assumes that the project requirements are well-defined and that the development process can proceed in a linear fashion. This may not be suitable for projects where the requirements are less well-defined or where frequent customer feedback is needed.

Overall, the V-model can be a useful development model for projects where testing is a key priority, and the project requirements are well-defined. However, it may not be as effective for projects with high levels of uncertainty or where customer feedback is needed throughout the development process.

Advantages of V-model:

1. Emphasizes testing: One of the main advantages of the V-model is that it places a strong emphasis on testing throughout the development process, which can help to identify and correct defects early in the development process.
2. Clear deliverables: The V-model provides clear deliverables at each stage of the development process, which can help to ensure that the project is on track and progressing as expected.
3. Easy to understand: The V-model is easy to understand and implement, making it a popular choice for many software development projects.
4. Risk management: The V-model includes risk management at each stage of the development process, which can help to identify and mitigate potential risks early in the development process.

Drawbacks of V-model:

1. Rigid and inflexible: The V-model can be less flexible than other development models, such as Agile, and may not be suitable for projects with high levels of uncertainty or where frequent customer feedback is needed. 不灵活
2. High documentation: The V-model requires a significant amount of documentation, which can be time-consuming and may not be necessary for all projects.
3. May not be suitable for small projects: The V-model may be too complex and time-consuming for small software development projects. 对于小项目不适合
4. Can be difficult to make changes: Once the development process has begun, it can be difficult to make changes to the project requirements or design, which can be a drawback for projects where the requirements may change over time. 改变困难 

Overall, the V-model can be a useful development model for projects where **testing** is a key priority and the project **requirements are well-defined.** However, it may not be as effective for projects with high levels of uncertainty or where customer feedback is needed throughout the development process.

易错点：

Agile also emphasizes risk management and continual improvement throughout the development process, but it does so in a different way than the V-model. Agile approaches risk management by breaking the project into smaller iterations and focusing on delivering working software frequently, which allows for early identification and mitigation of risks. Continuous improvement is achieved through regular retrospectives and feedback loops.

In contrast, the V-model focuses on identifying and managing risks during each stage of the development process and places a strong emphasis on testing and verification activities to reduce risks. The V-model is a sequential development process that emphasizes testing at each stage of development but does not necessarily prioritize continuous testing and feedback throughout the entire development process.

## Conclusion

• The Waterfall model is mostly used on smaller projects where the requirements are clear and there’s no need to change them quickly. It’s a well-structured approach. The stages are well-defined and easy to understand for all.

• Agile and Lean models suit small- and medium-sized projects with rapid changes required. The customer is involved during each stage. Limited planning is required to get started with a project. Businesses save both money and time as each iteration is discussed closely between the customer and the development team.

• The Spiral model combines the elements of the Prototyping and Waterfall models. The Spiral methodology is suitable for large, complex, and expensive projects. Its benefits are risk-management and stage-by-stage development.

• The DevOps is a newbie model. It allows for continuous software development, faster resolution of problems, happier, more productive teams, and higher employee engagement.
